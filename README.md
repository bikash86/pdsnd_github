### Explore US Bikeshare Data

In this project, we use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” *Chicago, New York City, and Washington*. We will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. We will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

In this project, we'll write code to provide the following information:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

    *most common month
    *most common day of week
    *most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip

    *most common start station
    *most common end station
    *most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration

    *total travel time
    *average travel time

#4 User info

    *counts of each user type
    *counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
    *earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used
We will use the three city dataset files for gaining insights into the data:

*chicago.csv
*new_york_city.csv
*washington.csv
