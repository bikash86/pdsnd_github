# Explore US Bikeshare Data

## Date created
The  project and the README file were created on **02/15/2019**

## Project Descrition
In this project, we use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” *Chicago, New York City, and Washington*. We will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. We will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

We'll write python code to provide the following information:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

    *most common month
    *most common day of week
    *most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip

    *most common start station
    *most common end station
    *most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration

    *total travel time
    *average travel time

#4 User info

    *counts of each user type
    *counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
    *earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

## Files used
We will use the three city dataset files for gaining insights into the data:

    *chicago.csv
    *new_york_city.csv
    *washington.csv

## Credits
All the city data files are provided by Udacity as part of Python course. Also, a Python script template by Udacity was used to create the Bikeshare.py file. Also, used Google and Stackoverflow to get syntax.
